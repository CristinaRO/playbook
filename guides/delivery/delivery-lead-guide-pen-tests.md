# Delivery leads guide for arranging pen tests

When a penetration test is arranged by a client on a site which is hosted by
dxw digital the delivery leads must find out the scope of the test and raise a
ticket in Zendesk as the Ops team will need to notify AWS as part of our
contract with them.

The Ops team needs to know the name of the client, AWS resources in scope,
and phone contact for pen testing team amongst other information as detailed
in this [pen test form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1LkfCwjp9JnxldjjNE7s8RS1eW8uuvcDQ6ruJpLKyuKY/edit) to be submitted.

AWS requires at least 5 days notice of a scheduled pen test as good practice
to allow them time to adjust their monitoring alerts.
