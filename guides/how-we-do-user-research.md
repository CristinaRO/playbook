# How we do user research

## Introduction

This guide explains how we do user research at dxw digital.

The guidance builds on our user research [principles](http://playbook.dxw.com/#/?id=user-research-principles) and [workflow](http://playbook.dxw.com/#/?id=user-research-workflow). It also builds on the [guidance for user research in the GOV.UK Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research) so we can help teams meet the [Government Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard).

Some of the guidance explains how to do user research in an effective, ethical and legal way. If your situation isn't covered, and you're not sure what to do, ask John Waterworth, the Head of User Research.

## How we get informed consent for user research

You must have informed consent from participants before you start any research activity with them. And you must then act only within the consent the participant has given.

This guide explains how we collect and keep evidence of informed consent at dxw digital. It builds on the general guidance on [getting informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research) in the Service Manual.

This guidance applies to all user researchers employed by dxw digital, both staff and contractors.

### Creating consent materials

#### Using dxw digital or client consent materials

There are two basic options:

1. The simplest and best option is to use our client’s existing consent materials. If they don’t have any, we can work with the client to create consent materials for the project, that the client can then reuse in future.

   In this case the client will manage all the research data we collect and keep the associated records of consent.

1. If using the client’s consent materials is not possible, or if the client asks us to do confidential research, we can use the dxw digital [information sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M) and [consent form](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k) templates.

   In this case dxw will manage the research data and keep the associated records of consent.

Whichever approach you take, make sure the materials follow the [good practice for informed consent](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/getting-users-consent-for-research#what-informed-consent-is) described in the Service manual. In particular, make sure that the material clearly describes both the client and dxw digital’s involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and findings.

#### Creating an information sheet

For each round or batch of research you do, you should create a specific information sheet that describes the research you are doing, and gives the participant the information they need.

You can use the same information sheet for several rounds or batches of research, as long as you are:

- doing the research for the same purpose
- doing the same things during the sessions
- collecting the same research data
- working with the same third-party organisations and suppliers

We have [template information sheets](https://drive.google.com/open?id=19lm5_gzzqzVP0NnNZZiqPhEwW2_i2bkI5apAaie4-4M) to use for the most common research situations.

#### Creating a consent form

If you are using a client’s consent form, make sure it clearly describes dxw digital’s involvement in the research, and how we will share research data and findings.

We have [template consent forms](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ilYXwrrkl9s4jMRkJm3uCWAON6bnEeYinKvPd-VOz8k) for the most common research situations.

If none of the standard consent forms will work for the research activities you are doing, speak to the Head of User Research.

### Collecting consent

#### Providing the information sheet

Give each participant a copy of the information sheet when they are being recruited for a research session. Check which format and channel works best for them - email attachment, paper letter, easy read, etc.

For a face to face research session, make sure you can provide a paper copy of both the information sheet and the associated privacy statement/privacy policy, if a participant asks for one.

#### Face to face research sessions

For user research sessions where you meet the participant in person, you can:

- give the participant a printed copy of the consent form
- send the consent form in an accessible digital format the participant can read using their assistive technology
- read the consent form aloud

Check with the participant which format works best for them.

Give the participant the consent form as soon as you can. Make sure they have time to read it carefully, and an opportunity to ask questions, before you ask the participant to sign .

#### Remote or telephone research sessions

For user research sessions where you will not meet the participant face to face, you can:

- attach the consent form to an email in an accessible digital format
- send a paper consent form in the post

Ask the participant to send a reply, confirming their consent. They can reply to the email, or post back a signed paper consent form.

#### During the session

At the start of the session, remind the participant that their participation is voluntary and they can stop or take a break at any time. Remind the participant about the different ways you are recording the session, and about anyone observing or listening in. Ask the participant to confirm their consent for the recording.

As the session continues, actively make sure you have the participant’s consent. For example, check in with the participant if they look concerned about an activity, or if you’re on a visit and  want to take a photo in a new area.

### Keeping a record of consent

For paper consent forms, scan or photograph the signed consent form and keep the image file in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.

For email responses, keep a copy of the consent form and of the participant’s reply in the folder with the research data you collect in the session.

Make sure the consent form, email reply and any research data have the same participant identifier. Do not include participant names or other personal identifiers in the document names.

## When and how we give incentives to research participants

It‘s normal to pay members of the public an incentive when they take part in research activities with us.

This guidance explains how we agree incentives with clients and pay incentives to participants.

It builds on the [basic guidance on giving incentives](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/find-user-research-participants#giving-incentives) in the Service Manual.

### Who gets incentives

We will normally pay incentives to members of the public, including people who use a government service for their work.
Professionals and members of groups may not be comfortable with getting an incentive themselves, and may want the incentive given to their organisation or donated to charity.

We do not expect to pay incentives to our clients‘ staff or to other public servants who take part in research related to their work.

When we are paying an incentive, make sure the participant knows the amount of the incentive and how they will receive it. Include this in the [information sheet](link to consent guidance).

### Agreeing incentives

It’s best to include estimates of incentives and other research expenses in the statement of work.

You can then confirm the exact incentive with the client when you are planning a batch of research.

On previous projects we have paid:

- £30 of Love2Shop gift vouchers for 1.5 hours of in-person usability testing
- £50 cash for geographically-specific users to take part in 1 hour of remote mobile usability testing
- £100 cash for an hour-long discovery research session with people likely to need assisted digital support
- £100 cash incentives for 45 minute research session with small businesses

### Paying incentives through a recruitment agency

If you are using a recruitment agency, ask them to pay the incentive to the participant. They will know how they do this. They may charge a small fee for handling the incentive.

If a participant contacts dxw digital to say they haven’t received their incentive, apologise and contact the agency to let them know.

### Paying incentives using shopping vouchers

Where we are paying the incentive, we use shopping vouchers. Normally from [Love2shop](https://www.highstreetvouchers.com/gifts/love2shop-gift-vouchers).

Request the amount of vouchers you need through the #dxw-purchasing Slack channel. They should be in £5 and £10 denominations so they are easier to spend.

In a face-to-face research session, give the vouchers to the participant and have them [sign a receipt](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-O9Qvp4kgs4t0JfQTIQF9dkiexv5mZtPNJfcxtmODZ0).

For a remote research session, use the #dxw-purchasing Slack channel to ask for the vouchers to be posted to the participant. Enclose the vouchers in a signed [thank you sheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=142Sf1QYH9wcySPf6GIOskv5qyJlc9phGZSeoCsxCoeU).

Handle the incentive at the start of the research session - either giving the incentive, or confirming that the incentive will be sent. This avoids any suggestion that participants have to ‘earn’ their incentive. It also means you don’t have to deal with the incentive if you want to stop a problematic session.

### Other ways to pay incentives

Other options for paying incentives a donation to a preferred charity, or a hamper that can be shared with a team.

### Withholding incentives

We do not pay the incentive (or any recruitment fee) if the participant doesn’t show up for their session. Although we might still pay the incentive if the participant tries to attend, but is stopped by an emergency or severe travel problem beyond their control.

If a recruitment agency provides a participant who does not match the brief, we will pay the participant their incentive, but we will not pay the agency their recruitment fee.
