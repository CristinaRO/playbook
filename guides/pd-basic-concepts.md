# Pipeline Deals: basic concepts

## Introduction

We use Pipeline Deals to record information about:

* Sales leads
* Sales orders
* Customer contact information
* Customer organisation data

We store this information so that:

* We keep track of sales leads and make sure we act on them all
* We keep track of the reasons why we do not win work
* We can efficiently allocate sales and administration work to people in the team
* We know what all of our current contracts are, who they are for and what service we're providing
* We know when our contracts will end
* We know who in a client organisation we should speak to if we need something
* We can provide Management Information to the Crown Commercial Service

We use PipelineDeals because it gives us a lot of flexibility to define fields for storing data, can easily import and export data, has a complete api and features that allow us to automate common tasks.

## Principles

In order for Pipeline Deals to work well for us, it is important that we stick to some basic principles:

* Every potentially viable lead must be added to Pipeline Deals as soon as we know about it
* Every purchase order number that is provided by a client is recorded on a Pipeline Deals order
* All orders contain complete and accurate information
* It must be possible for someone with no context or prior knowledge to read an order in Pipeline Deals and have a reasonable idea what it is
