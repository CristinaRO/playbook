# Contributing to the Playbook

## What you will need
1. A GitHub account
2. To be invited to the [dxw organisation](https://github.com/dxw)
3. To be invited to the [staff team](https://github.com/orgs/dxw/teams/staff)

## Why GitHub?
We are all encouraged to help shape dxw and help it grow. The decisions we make are represented in the playbook so it's important to have an open and collaborative means to evolve it.

GitHub allows us to:
1. Present our ideas against those existing
2. Discuss other people's ideas
3. Find agreement and get things [changed](http://playbook.dxw.com/)
4. Store a history of our decision making
